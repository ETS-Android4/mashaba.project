Android Studio Application:
This App helps entrepreneurs who sell goods on credit at a percentage deposit (current owed= total owed - total owed*perc)
it subracts the percentage that was deposited from the Total owed and prints out the current amount owed by the customer.
The user can type in 100% if the customer paid in full, or leave the percentage control empty if no deposit was made.
